Check if the first text and the second text are semantically equivalent:

[[[First Text]]]

{{$first_text}}

[[[End of First Text]]]


[[[Second Text]]]
                
{{$second_text}}
                
[[[Second of First Text]]]

The result should be a valid json like:

{
    "success": true or false,
    "message": "If they are not equivalent, explain here the difference"
}


RESULT:
