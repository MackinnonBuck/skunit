Check if the text has the condition semantically:

[[[Input Text]]]

{{$text}}

[[[End of Input Text]]]


[[[Condition]]]
                
{{$condition}}
                
[[[End of Condition]]]

The result should be a valid json like:

{
    "success": true or false,
    "message": "If they are not equivalent, explain here the difference"
}


RESULT:
